    "# Heston Volatility Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we implement the Heston implied volatility approximation via multivariate Chebyshev interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare results for the multivariate Chebyshev implementations using Numpy, Tensorflow and Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyse approximation accuracy for Heston implied volatility use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Heston Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarise the Heston model to put our example and parametrisation choices into the wider context of implied volatility modelling. Heston model is a model for the price process of a financial asset $S_t$. The price process $S_t$ is described by the diffusion\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  d S_t   &= \\mu S_t dt + \\sqrt{v_t} S_t d W^S_t, \\\\\n",
    "  d v_t &= \\kappa \\left(\\theta - v_t\\right) dt + \\xi \\sqrt{v_t} d W^v_t, \\\\\n",
    "  d W^S_t d W^v_t &= \\rho dt\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with initial conditions $S_0>0$ and $v_0>0$ at $t=0$ and correlated Brownian motions $W^S_t$ and $W^v_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For option pricing methods in Heston model we refer to the standard literature. Implied volatilities for a given term (or time to maturity) $T$ and strike price $K$ are obtained by inverting Black's formula given a forward Vanilla option price derived in Heston model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For implied volatility modelling we are interested in forward prices. As a consequence, we can disregard the drift $\\mu$. Implied volatility in Heston model is driven by the parameters of the squared volatility process $v_t$. In particular, we have the following properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $\\sqrt{v_0}$ controls short term volatility.\n",
    "  - $\\sqrt{\\theta}$ controls long term volatility.\n",
    "  - $\\log(2) / \\kappa$ represents the half life of the expectation of $v_t$ moving from $v_0$ to $\\theta$.\n",
    "    This controls the term structure of at-the-money volatilities.\n",
    "  - $\\rho$ controls the volatility skew (or volatility slope in strike direction).\n",
    "  - $\\xi$ controls the volatility smile (or volatility curvature in strike direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our parametrisation of implied volatilities we will use two properties of Heston model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expectation of squared volatility.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of the squared volatility $v_T$ for a given term $T\\geq 0$ is given as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E} \\left[ v_T \\right] = v_0 e^{-\\kappa T} + \\theta \\left(1 - e^{-\\kappa T}\\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We use this this property to define an *average standard deviation* of asset prices as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\nu_{(v_0, \\theta, \\kappa)}(T) = \\sqrt{\\left[v_0 e^{-\\kappa T} + \\theta \\left(1 - e^{-\\kappa T}\\right)\\right] T}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The average standard deviation is used to normalise option strikes $K$. That is, We define the option moneyness as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  {\\cal M} = \\frac{\\log\\left(K/S_0\\right)}{\\nu_{(v_0, \\theta, \\kappa)}(T)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feller condition.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Feller condition for the squared volatility process is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\xi^2 \\leq 2 \\kappa \\theta.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This condition ensures that the squared volatility process remains positive, i.e. $v_t > 0$ for $t>0$. Violation of Feller condition e.g. by high vol-of-vol parameter $\\xi$ is typically accepted to achieve reasonable fits in calibrations. However, high vol-of-vol parameters may cause numerical instabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control (or limit) the extend of Feller condition violation we use a *Feller factor* parameter to parametrise volatility smile. We define the Feller factor as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  {\\cal F} = \\frac{\\xi^2}{2 \\kappa \\theta}.\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Implied volatility function parametrisation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given model or market observation implied volatility $\\sigma_{IV}$ is a function of the option term $T$ and the strike price $K$. That is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\sigma_{IV}\\left(T, K\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "also forms a volatility surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis we extend the volatility surface function by the Heston model parameters and apply a parameter transformation. Our target function is $f:{\\cal D}\\rightarrow R$ with ${\\cal D} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^8$ such that\n",
